        We thought it would be fun to create a platform to deliver a randomly generated security every time you visit the site.
        We also decided to invest $1000 USD in 10 randomly selected stocks. (Coming Soon!) The randomly generated stocks
        are retrieved from a large database of all publicly traded stocks in the United States. The
        available stocks are restricted to what is traded on the NASDAQ or the NYSE, we do not include penny stocks in our
        database. We also included a fun quote for your amusement.

        <b>We do not advocate that you invest money into randomly selected securities!</b> This page was made to give people
        access to a random stock generator, and for general entertainment.
